✅ Problem 1: Student Grade Management

Description:
Write a program that manages a student's grade. The program should:

Ask the user to enter marks (0–100).
Use if to check if the input is valid (0–100).
Use if...else to check if the student passed (≥50) or failed.
Use a switch to assign a grade:
    90–100: A
    75–89: B
    60–74: C
    50–59: D
    Below 50: F
Use a for loop to print the grade 3 times (like a stamp).
Use a while loop to let the user check grades of multiple students until they type -1.
Use a do...while loop to ask at least once if they want to continue checking another student.
