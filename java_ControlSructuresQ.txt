✅ Problem 1: Student Grade Management

Description:
Write a program that manages a student's grade. The program should:

Ask the user to enter marks (0–100).
Use if to check if the input is valid (0–100).
Use if...else to check if the student passed (≥50) or failed.
Use a switch to assign a grade:
    90–100: A
    75–89: B
    60–74: C
    50–59: D
    Below 50: F
Use a for loop to print the grade 3 times (like a stamp).
Use a while loop to let the user check grades of multiple students until they type -1.
Use a do...while loop to ask at least once if they want to continue checking another student.



✅ Problem 2: Simple ATM Simulation

Description:
Write a program that simulates an ATM machine.

Start with a balance of 1000.
Use if to check if the entered PIN is correct (e.g., PIN = 1234).
Use if...else to check if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the balance.
Use a switch menu to let the user:
    1 → Check balance
    2 → Deposit money
    3 → Withdraw money
    4 → Exit
Use a for loop to allow only 3 attempts for PIN entry.
Use a while loop to keep showing the menu until the user chooses Exit.
Use a do...while loop to ask at least once if the user wants to perform another transaction.
